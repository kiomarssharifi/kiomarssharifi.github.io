abstract: This study explores using theta-burst stimulation on the right temporoparietal junction to improve theory of mind in children and adolescents with high-functioning autism. It found that this technique significantly enhanced implicit mentalizing abilities without affecting egocentric bias, suggesting the right temporoparietal junction as a potential therapy target for autism.
