abstract: This study uses fMRI to explore how humans remember the value of objects over time. Initially, brain regions involved in value memory, like the occipital and prefrontal areas, show strong activation, but this diminishes over days, except in the ventral temporal area. Long-term value memory is also encoded in subcortical regions, linked to memory performance. The study highlights the changing neural basis of value memory in humans, with implications for understanding habit formation.
