    abstract = "{Obtaining valuable objects motivates many of our daily decisions. However, the neural underpinnings of object processing based on human value memory are not yet fully understood. Here, we used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine activations due to value memory as participants passively viewed objects before, minutes after, and 1–70 days following value training. Significant value memory for objects was evident in the behavioral performance, which nevertheless faded over the days following training. Minutes after training, the occipital, ventral temporal, interparietal, and frontal areas showed strong value discrimination. Days after training, activation in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions decreased, whereas the parietal areas showed sustained activation. In addition, days-long value responses emerged in certain subcortical regions, including the caudate, ventral striatum, and thalamus. Resting-state analysis revealed that these subcortical areas were functionally connected. Furthermore, the activation in the striatal cluster was positively correlated with participants’ performance in days-long value memory. These findings shed light on the neural basis of value memory in humans with implications for object habit formation and cross-species comparisons.}",
