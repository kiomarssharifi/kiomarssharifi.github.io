abstract: This research investigates how monkeys' brains respond to objects with different reward values during visual search tasks. It finds that efficient target recognition is linked to enhanced spatial processing in the brain's ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, with larger neural receptive fields corresponding to more effective searches. This aligns with predictions from the Multi-Alternative Attention-modulated Drift Diffusion Model, highlighting a connection between neural activity and visual search efficiency.
