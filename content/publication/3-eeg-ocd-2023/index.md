abstract: A study on OCD treatment tested transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on 39 patients, comparing sham, 1-mA, and 2-mA intensities. The 2-mA stimulation significantly improved OCD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and cognitive functions, while 1-mA showed milder benefits. The study suggests intensified tDCS, especially at 2-mA, as a promising approach for OCD therapy.
